# Corbent's Interactive Crew

Steam workshop link: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2774848292

## Description
Adds an item to give contextual commands to your crewmates, a GUI to organize them, and new capabilities to your crewmates.

## Goal
The goal is to improve the crew experience by making them more interactive, feel more alive, and maybe even useful. 

## Important Notes

* Strongly suggest to backup your worlds as with any mod. I don't think this can do any permanent damage but you never know. Especially if you are going to try to make it interact with any other obscure mod from the workshop.

* The hand can only address the crew members that are actually following you, so to grab them from your ship you will need to use the regular **"E"** interaction.

* Didn't test in multiplayer. Should work fine, but in case of any weirdness, please report.

## Features
* The commander's hand: An item that allows you to tell your crewmates to do stuff depending on what you click.
* A GUI to organize your followers.
* Most passive or automatic crew skills are now active skills that can be used on commmand.
* Increased crew member energy to 100 from 10 so they can actually shoot things.
* Increased movement speed to make it easier for them to keep up and reduce teleporting.
* Crew members can swim now. No idea why that was disabled.
* Given crew members the ability to talk when attacking and killing things, just like regular NPCs.
* A few new dialog lines for all of the new interactions.
* Implemented the dialog line randomization fix so they actually use their lists instead of repeating the same thing over and over.
* DateBound fully integrated, courtesy of Audie, creator of the mod.

**A note about Datebound**: I see people complaining about Datebound not working and I'm probably going to start getting those here. All Datebound does is add a new role crew role named crewmembersobff, dubbed as "Partner" which contains more variety of dialog lines plus randomization, which normal crew member don't have normally. It's not a complex relationship building mod.

### The commander's hand
The commander's hand is a one handed item crafted in the basic crafting menu for 1 pixel. It's function is to give commands to your crew members as follows:
* Click on yourself to toggle the vanilla follow/wait state. Works at any distance apparently.
* Click on the crew member to activate their skill at any time! Medics and chemists are more useful now. 60 second cooldown still applies.
* Click on a hostile target to have your crew member focus on it.
* Click on any open location to have your crew member stand there and not wander around.
* Click on a piece of furniture to make your crew member sit/lay/whatever on it until told otherwise.
* Click on a button, switch or light to have your crew member operate it.
* Hold shift to use all of these features on your second follower!!!

### Active skills
* As mentioned, most formerly passive or automatic skills are now active skills. You can ask your medic to heal you, your chemist to make you glow and so on.
* Increased the duration of the yellow chemist's glow effect to 5 minutes. So now you can keep it up indefinitely. making them useful if you want to have a light and use your EPP for something else.
* If you use Frackin Universe some crew members might become too strong because their effects have a longer duration than the 90 second cooldown, allowing you to keep them on indefinitely.

### Known issues
* NPCs might refuse to use some furniture. Not related to furniture type since they might refuse on one and use another identical one just fine. Maybe related to the furniture position or orientation.
* When you mark an invalid or unreachable target crew members might get fixated on it. Just get away and it should be fixed.
